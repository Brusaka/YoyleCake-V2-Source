USE THE .bat FILE (in the compiling folder) TO COMPILE PROPERLY SINCE 0.7.1 BROKE PSYCH ENGINE 0.6.3 LOL

IF ANYTHING LUA RELATED BREAKS
DO
haxelib remove hxcpp
haxelib instal hxcpp 4.2.1

YOU SHOULD BE DONE AFTER THAT
AND PLEASE USE HAXE 4.2.5 ONLY
https://haxe.org/download/file/4.2.5/haxe-4.2.5-win64.exe/
